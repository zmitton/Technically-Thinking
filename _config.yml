# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am Zac Mitton, a web developer living in the San Francisco Bay area.
  This blog does not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions that
  people actually know about me in real life. They would probably think I was weird.
  I am. The point of this blog is express some weird ideas in hopes that other
  weird people (like you?) come across them and we can connect.
